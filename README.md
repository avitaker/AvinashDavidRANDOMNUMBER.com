# AvinashDavidRANDOMNUMBER.com
Personal portfolio and blog website. This was the initial work performed to build my personal website, which can now be viewed at avinashdavid.com

## Installation and usage
Serve on localhost and run.

## Important note
This is not the final code for the website, since development moved to an active web host.
